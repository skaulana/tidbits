###  Additional info

Originally written for a ray tracer assignment in the Berkeley
class CS 184. Use gmake to build. Images are output in PPM format
which you can then convert to PNG to match the repo.

Features: rendering of spheres and polygons, simple Phong shading,
point and directional lights, shadows, reflections, anti-aliasing.

You can also specify --debug when running the program to get status
updates every time an additional 10% of the main loop finishes.
