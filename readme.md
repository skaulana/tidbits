## kcom/tidbits

Just a smattering of miscellanea that don't really warrant their own repos.

* `chess_visualizer/` - shows the basic lines of attack and overall threats given
  a chessboard state. Old school PHP with flat files.
* `distance_calculator/` - submission for an old interview question:
  "Given the latitude and longitude of an arbitrary location and a SQL table full
  of locations with their latitudes and longitudes, write some PHP code that will
  calculate and display the distance from the arbitrary location to every location
  within the table."
* `k5/` - blogging scripts used to power [kaulana.com][1] in its 5th version. Useful
  as a complete PHP app, or just the platform layer to power a blog's backend.
