Just a smattering of miscellanea that don't really warrant their own repos.

* `chess_visualizer/` - shows the basic lines of attack and threats of a given
  chessboard state. Old school PHP with flat files.
* `distance_calculator/` - submission to an old interview question:
  "Given the latitude and longitude of an arbitrary location and a SQL table full
  of locations with their latitudes and longitudes, write some PHP code that will
  calculate and display the distance from the arbitrary location to every location
  within the table."
* `k5/` - blogging scripts used to power [kaulana.com][1] in its 5th version. Useful
  as a complete PHP app, or as the platform layer powering a blog's backend.
* `mfuof/` - e.g. Move Files Up One Folder. Applet intended to be placed in the
  Windows 'Send To' folder as an accelerator.
* `algo4.cs` - solution to the strongly connected components (SCC) problem from
   the Coursera MOOC [Algorithms I][2].
* `hexparse.php` - generates Verilog code to initialize a BlockRAM with hex data.
